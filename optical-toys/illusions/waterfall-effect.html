                <strong>What:</strong> This is the second
                <a href="motion-aftereffect.html">optical toy</a>
                on this site demonstrating this effect, although the other is
                using spirals they have a similar effect, albeit a little more
                spinny. A motion aftereffect occurs when you observe a moving
                pattern for a while, and then begin to look at something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> Stare at the center for a while, and
                then look at something nearby, be it the wall, art, or your own
                hands&hellip; you should see them appear to bulge and grow, or
                shrink and contract.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also close a single eye, and experience it with &hellip;
                well, half of your site!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Explain It:</strong> Again, it&rsquo;s tricky to explain
                clearly, but here&rsquo;s a great encounter [1] described by
                Aristotle himself!
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    also when persons turn away from looking at objects in
                    motion, e.g. rivers, and especially those which flow very
                    rapidly, they find that the visual stimulations still
                    present themselves, for the things really at rest are then
                    seen moving
                </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Ultimately it is believed that your neurons are coding a
                particular movement, and reduce their responses with time of
                exposure to a constantly moving stimulus; and when you look
                away, the neurons that are coding the opposite movement are more
                active, and hence you see the inverse.

                I've researched these illusions in my spare time but am clearly
                not any kind of expert and my explainations are pretty smooth
                brained, if you find something mis-cited, earlier examples, or
