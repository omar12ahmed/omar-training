                <strong>What:</strong> The Lilac Chaser is perhaps my favorite
                illusion of all time, largely because it combines so many
                different illusions into one amazing piece. It was first built
                by Jeremy Hinton in 2005, and has made the internet rounds many
                times! To get this thing going all you really need to do is
                focus on the dot in the center, the rest should hit you one
                effect after another.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first effect I observe is the afterimage effect, whereby the
                empty hole in the circle suddenly gives you a circle of the
                inverted color, so at its initial settings, there will be a
                green circle… that alone is amazing.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, you’ll get hit by the Troxler Fade, whereby the
                gradient circles should suddenly disappear. Often for me, it is
                as though the green circle eats them up and they’re gone.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, of all things, the green circle will keep circling…
                if you stare that this for a really long time, and then look
                away you’ll still be seeing green, it’s incredible.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> Here you can mix up the colors, and the
                amount of dots, you’ll be able to see that the inverse disc can
                more or less show you the full gamut of colors.

                    which overlies these same effects with a little more
                    confidence than me.
