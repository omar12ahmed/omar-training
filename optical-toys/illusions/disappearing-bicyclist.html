                <strong>What:</strong> This is one of famous puzzle makers Sam
                Loyd&rsquo;s vanishing puzzles, Sam Loyd [1] himself is one of
                the most historied and famous puzzle makers and has published
                hundreds of thousands of puzzles. This one, the Disappearing
                Bicyclist is one of my favorites, using a simple rotation to
                hide the secrets of the puzzle, yet show you in full plain sight
                how it is operating.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> This one is relatively simple to
                operate, count the bicyclists on the screen, and then click
                anywhere and count again, you&rsquo;ll see that they go from 13
                to 12, and hence the conundrum will arrive&hellip; where did the
                extra come from (or go!?)
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Explain it:</strong> In this case, while it&rsquo;s
                tricky to see (especially in the analog format), the boys are
                slithered away each by a little piece, they all will seem a
                little smaller, and when you do the full count, they&rsquo;ll be
                no more. A nice way to approach it is by looking at and counting
                the flags as well.
