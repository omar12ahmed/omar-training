                <strong>What:</strong> Some dots are here to stay, and others
                disappear, or at least that’s how it goes in this illusion,
                fantastically named an Extinction Illusion, named by its creator
                Jacques Ninio [1] … In this optical toy when you focus a single
                dot you’ll see (or not see?) that the other darker dots vanish,
                while it goes against my intuition, it’s named here as a variant
                of the Hermann Grid
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> You can customize more or less this
                whole thing! The thickness of the lines for me is a key piece to
                make the illusion stronger, as well as getting the contrasts
                into place, but you’ll also see that certain color clashes get
                it working just as well. You’ll also see that the distances
                between the areas are pretty important.
            </p>

                <strong>Explain it:</strong> If this is anything like the
                Hermann Grid the “how” is relatively uncertain, that said the
                illusion gives a feeling not so dissimilar to the
                <a href="troxler-fade.html">Troxler Fade</a>
                where some information is lost to the brain as it focuses on a
                single stimuli.

                    disappear.

                I've researched these illusions in my spare time but am clearly
                not any kind of expert and my explainations are pretty smooth
                brained, if you find something mis-cited, earlier examples, or
                general mistakes please new let me know via
