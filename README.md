# Omar Training

Welcome to the "Omar Training" repository! This repository aims to provide a
series of tasks to help our intern learn fundamental JavaScript within the Node
environment. The tasks will involve working with various node modules to build
practical applications and gain hands-on experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start with the tasks, please ensure that you have the following
requirements fulfilled.

Either:

1. **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can
   download it from the official website:
   [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). We recommend using the LTS
   (Long-Term Support) version for stability and compatibility.

2. **npm**: npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js. It is a
   powerful package manager that allows you to install and manage external
   libraries and modules. To verify that npm is installed, open your terminal
   and run the following command:

    ```sh
    npm -v
    ```

or:

1. **Install n**: n is a Node.js version manager that allows you to install and
   switch between different Node.js versions. To install n, open your terminal
   and run the following command:

    ```sh
    brew install n
    ```

2. **Install Node.js**: Once you have n installed, you can use it to install
   Node.js. To install the latest LTS version, run the following command:

    ```sh
    n lts
    ```

If you see a version number printed, you have npm installed. If not, please
refer to the Node.js installation documentation to troubleshoot the issue.

## Tasks

The tasks provided in this repository will cover a wide range of JavaScript
concepts and utilize various Node.js modules. Each task will have its own
dedicated folder containing the necessary files and instructions. Feel free to
explore the tasks in any order you prefer, but we recommend following the
suggested sequence to build a strong foundation progressively.
