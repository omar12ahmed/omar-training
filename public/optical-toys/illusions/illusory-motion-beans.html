                <strong>What:</strong> This effect, and honestly the largest
                body of work you’ll see when you look into both optical
                illusions and illusory motion has been created by Japanese
                artist Akiyoshi Kitaoka, a true master of the art. If the
                illusion didn’t immediately hit you, there is no animation at
                all happening within the illusion, it’s 100% your brain playing
                tricks providing a weird spinning motion in the peripherals of
                your vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> You can change the colors, spacing, and
                sizes here, all of which should largely still give you the same
                effects, although if you remove the contrasting a lot the motion
                should largely fade away.
            </p>

                <strong>Explain it:</strong> It’s mentioned a few times on
                Optical Toys that its a little abstract, but again the Wikipedia
                description gives a relatively clear outline to the current
                thought reasons:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Apparent motion in optical art has been suggested to be
                    caused by the difference in neural signals between black and
                    white parts of an image. While white parts may produce an
                    “on-off” signal, the black parts produce an “off-on” signal.
                    This means for a black part and a white part presented
                    simultaneously, the “on” part of the signal is separated in
                    time, possibly resulting in the stimulation of motion
                    detectors. [2]

                I've researched these illusions in my spare time but am clearly
                not any kind of expert and my explainations are pretty smooth
                brained, if you find something mis-cited, earlier examples, or
                general mistakes please new let me know via
