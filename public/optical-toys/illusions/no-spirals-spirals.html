                <strong>What:</strong> The real name for this illusion is the
                intertwining illusion, which was documented by Dr. Baingio Pinna
                in 2002 [1], is the first of Pinna’s illusions that I’ve
                re-coded up in optical toys, and is my personal favorite. If you
                hadn’t picked up on it already the illusion is a series of
                concentric circles, yes concentric, and is not at all a spiral.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> There are some neat things to play with
                here, primarily you can change the angles to see when the
                illusion is strongest for you and when it breaks completely… The
                same goes for the colors of the squares and background, you’ll
                notice that the contrasts are key to making it stronger!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Explain it:</strong> If you played around with the
                colors in the customization tools you would see that the
                contrast is part of the key here, while I couldn’t access the
                cited paper, some perusing [2] has told me that this is your
                peripheral vision (where the illusion really gets you) is
                tracking the angles of the squares and is guessing that the
                shapes are spirals, which then causes you to perceive it this
                way, even with the knowledge that they’re not.

                I've researched these illusions in my spare time but am clearly
                not any kind of expert and my explainations are pretty smooth
                brained, if you find something mis-cited, earlier examples, or
                general mistakes please new let me know via
