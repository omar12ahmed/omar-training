                <strong>What:</strong> This silhouette illusion is probably one
                of the harder to replicate, that being said, the effect and awe
                of getting it working is also probably one of the most amazing
                to me. Here you see a duck that is spinning, the thing is, with
                a silhouetted image there isn’t really enough visual data to
                tell if it’s going clockwise or anticlockwise as there are
                multiple positions where the image looks exactly the same. The
                most popular version of this is the spinning dancer [1] by
                Nobuyuki Kayahara.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my version I’ve used a simple duck, I had experimented with a
                few different models, but funnily enough the code to render this
                in 3d [2] was using a rubber duck, and it felt like it was
                perfectly appropriate to use it, and in many ways the simplicity
                of the duck made it a lot easier for me to be able to switch the
                direction with my mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> You can use the configurations to
                change the ducks' direction, but you shouldn’t need to… that
                said, if you can’t get it to rotate with your brain you can
                click the button and the direction shift will make your brain
                see it’s spinning the other way, you can then watch it for five
                to ten seconds, close your eyes briefly and switch it back, open
                and you shouldn’t see the change. I have been able to flip it
                semi-regularly by doing a large blink when the duck is facing
                toward me (or away).
            </p>
            <p>
                Another fun trick is to put a mirror up next to this (or your
                phone next to a mirror), you would expect to see two ducks
                rotating in different directions, but that is not always the
                case!
