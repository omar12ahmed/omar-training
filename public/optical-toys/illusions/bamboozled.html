                <strong>What:</strong> Bamboozled is one of my favorites, mostly
                because I stumbled upon it from this meme [1] and decided It
                must be a part of the Optical Toys collection. The perception
                here is that the tall bamboo sticks appear to be both angled and
                will move back and forth in the peripherals of your vision.

                <strong>How To:</strong> You can change the sizes and amount to
                make the illusion stronger for you, as well as mess with the
                colors. Ultimately you’ll find that the outline colors that
                create the contrasting shapes will change the efficacy of the
                effects, though for me also a lot of smaller squares seem to
                work best.

                <strong>Explain it:</strong> This is a type of illusory motion,
                where the part of your brain that perceives motion is getting
                tripped up by the black and white outlines… as per Wikipedia:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    Apparent motion has been suggested to be caused by the
                    difference in neural signals between black and white parts
                    of an image. While white parts may produce an “on-off”
                    signal, the black parts produce an “off-on” signal. This
                    means for a black part and a white part presented
                    simultaneously, the “on” part of the signal is separated in
                    time, possibly resulting in the stimulation of motion
                    detectors
