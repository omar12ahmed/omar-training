                <strong>What:</strong> Ok, this one is clearly not an optical
                illusion, but it&rsquo;s a great optical effect that translates
                really well into the digital era, that said, if you get your
                hands on a physical one the tactile response is very fun!
            </p>
            <p>
                It&rsquo;s inclusion is important because the kaleidoscope is
                one of the very first optical toys, the name coined by
                it&rsquo;s inventor David Brewster, in 1815 [1] &hellip; he was
                later knighted for his work, in 1831, so thats Sir David
                Brewster.
            </p>

                <strong>How To:</strong> In this version you can drag and drop
                an image from your desktop and it&rsquo;ll be there! You can
                also alter the amount of shards. I think in a perfect world
                I&rsquo;d have multiple hexagons mirroring, but I couldn&rsquo;t
                quite get the math right (I&rsquo;m no David Brewster).
                I&rsquo;ll update this if I get it right!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Explain it:</strong> Carefully &amp; perfectly
                positioned mirrors.
