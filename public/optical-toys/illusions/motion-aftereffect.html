                <strong>What:</strong> This optical illusion (though im not
                entirely sure it falls into the illusion category) demonstrates
                an effect that occurs when you observe a moving pattern for a
                certain amount of time, and then begin looking at something
                else. This can occur naturally in nature, such as looking at a
                waterfall and then observing the cliffs beside it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also coded up another version of this
                <a href="waterfall-effect.html">similar effect</a>
                A similar effect on this site! Using straight lines rather than
                a spiral.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> In this example, you need to stare into
                the center of the spirals, which are turning into a single
                direction, with an outer spinning the other way. After around
                twenty to thirty seconds you can look away, ideally at some art
                on the wall, outside, or your hands and you will see an inverse
                motion happening.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Explain It:</strong> This is another one that comes down
                to how your neurons process data, something I don’t understand
                too well, but am happy to quote.

                <p>
                    Neurons coding a particular movement reduce their responses
                    with time of exposure to a constantly moving stimulus; this
                    is neural adaptation
                </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    One theory is that perception of stationary objects—for
                    example, rocks beside a waterfall—is coded as the balance
                    among the baseline responses of neurons coding all possible
                    directions of motion.

                    I believe these are the spirals in my case.

            <p class="disclaimer">
                I've researched these illusions in my spare time but am clearly
                not any kind of expert and my explainations are pretty smooth
                brained, if you find something mis-cited, earlier examples, or
                general mistakes please new let me know via
