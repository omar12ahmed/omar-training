                <strong>What:</strong> While I still feel that “dot’s that won’t
                quit” is a better name, this illusion is actually called the
                scintillating grid illusion which was discovered by Elke
                Lingelbach in 1994, although it also falls into the category of
                Hermann Grid Illusion [1] (I don’t have this one built yet, but
                will in future!) The effect is simple and strong, you’ll see
                dark dots appearing in the intersection circles when they aren’t
                there!
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> You can customize the colors and
                achieve varying degrees of this effect, for example, they work
                when flipped and you will see light dots. You can adjust the
                colors and sizes and see exactly which contrasting sets it works
                with. For me, a very small size is still extremely effective,
                absolutely no chance of counting those dots.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Explain it:</strong> It seems like there is some
                discourse currently as to what exactly is causing the effect
                previous understanding was that your receptive fields were
                miscalculating the light and dark colors. However, those smart
                folk at MIT are suggesting something different. I’m no authority
                and struggle to gain any understanding of any explanation but
                feel free to go down the rabbit hole [2]. All in all, I think
                we’re still in limbo as to the exact reason (using your brain to
                study your brain is hard!)

                    strong.

                    While this effect that I’ve renamed
                    <a href="dots-that-will-quit.html">“dots that will quit”</a>
                    is not exactly related, I consider it a cousin, since the
                    dots dissapear rather than appear!

                I've researched these illusions in my spare time but am clearly
                not any kind of expert and my explainations are pretty smooth
                brained, if you find something mis-cited, earlier examples, or
                general mistakes please new let me know via
