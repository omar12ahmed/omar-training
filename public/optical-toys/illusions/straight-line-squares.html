                <strong>What:</strong> This one should hit you fairly quickly,
                but if it hasn’t yet, it’s that the lines are all horizontal
                here, but appear to your brain to have angles… the illusion has
                a couple of names, it was first named the Kindergarten pattern
                in 1898 [1] After a weaving pattern, and later as the Cafe Wall
                Illusion brought back into the light by Richard Gregory [2],
                which it is most commonly named now.

                <strong>How To:</strong> You can play around a lot here with the
                customization tools, and there are some good things to note, if
                you reduce the contrast between the two colors the illusion will
                more or less disappear right in front of your eyes. You can also
                edit the sizes of the squares and find where the illusion will
                hit you the strongest. For me, it’s when the squares are rather
                small and a little tall. You’ll also be able to remove the line
                color altogether and again see the illusion evaporate.

                <strong>Explain it:</strong> All in all, this is not very well
                understood, and from my research, there is no clear answer that
                doesn’t completely explode my smooth brain, it seems to be
                falling between the work that your eyes do to understand shapes
                and lines, and collides with what your brain does to piece
                together that same information.
