                <strong>What:</strong> This illusion, created by Alan Stubbs in
                2006 [1], has the neat effect of a growing light (or shadow if
                you customize above to those colors) when you move your head
                towards and away from the image. It has the extra effect of
                making you look like you’ve forgot your glasses and are trying
                to read whats on screen, or like you’re straight up a chicken.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> Sit straight on from the screen and
                move your head back and forth, like a bird. When you’re closer
                the gradient within will appear to grow, and when you dip out it
                will shrink back again. You can mess with a few settings here to
                see different effects, it works great with a dark gradient, and
                the contrasting colors can give you a bigger or weaker effect.

                    on the illusion, you can see that I’ve used his original
                    colors.
