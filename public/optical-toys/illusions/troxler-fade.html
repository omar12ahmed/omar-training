                <strong>What:</strong> The Troxler fade, named after the
                discoverer Ignaz Paul Vital Troxler [1], was documented in 1804
                in his paper named “On the disappearance of given objects from
                our visual field” (that’s an English translation, it was in
                German). You’ll notice, as you stare into the center and focus
                on it, the outer ring begins to fade, and then eventually
                disappears entirely… it will take moving your head or a hard
                blink to see it again.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> There’s not much to customizing this
                optical illusion, you can change the colors and thickness of the
                ring which will give you some idea as to how far you can push
                it.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Explain it:</strong> When you focus on an object the
                neurons that are used to process that information start to
                become fatigued and slow down, which leads to them slowing down
                and processing slower… eventually your brain begins to fill in
                the gaps as to what it’s seeing in between with the information
                it has, which in this case is largely a blank canvas… eventually
                the ring fades entirely and is patched up with the blank space.

            <p class="disclaimer">
                I've researched these illusions in my spare time but am clearly
                not any kind of expert and my explainations are pretty smooth
                brained, if you find something mis-cited, earlier examples, or
                general mistakes please new let me know via
                <b>toymaker@toms.toys</b>, be kind!
