                <strong>What:</strong> This isn’t the first time we’ve got some
                Akiyosi Kitaoka [1] on the site, and it won’t be the last. This
                is a classic example of illusory motion, where the balls appear
                to be moving in the peripherals of your vision, but are in fact
                completely still.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> Mix up the colors, sizes, and spacing
                to see how it affects the illusion. I found that the illusion is
                strongest when the colors are contrasting, and the balls not
                super large, although I could see it there
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Explain it:</strong> Another Illusory Moment, and as
                always the Wikipedia [2] has a great description of the current
                thought process. I’ve also mentioned within the
                <a href="illusory-motion-beans.html">illusory motion beans</a>
                illusion how this is working (as I can understand it), your
                brain is used to perceiving things that fade one way or the
                other as moving, and the contrasting colors here are causing a
                collusion of the senses.

                    main source for this illusion, Akiyoishi has better colors
                    and more effective patterns.

                general mistakes please new let me know via
