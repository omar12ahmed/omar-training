                <strong>What:</strong> The Ouchi illusion is an illusion named
                after its inventor, Japanese graphics artist Hajime Ouchi [1],
                in 1977, you’ll notice that the disc in the center appears to
                hover above the background, and when you’re moving your head it
                can appear to be moving slightly when in reality we know its
                static and a fixed 2D circle.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How To:</strong> You’ll be able to ramp up the intensity
                of this one by increasing the contrasting colors (black and
                white being the original artist’s design), also the length and
                height of the rectangles can be changed, for me when they are
                short and long (or long and short) the illusion is strongest.
                Also if I scroll up and down slightly (adding a little motion)
                it causes the effect to be much stronger.

                <strong>Explain it:</strong> Perusing around and reading a few
                papers left me more confused than I began, though I eventually
                found a great description:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    The illusion is caused by random eye movements, which are
                    independent in the horizontal and vertical directions.
                    However, the two types of patterns in the figure nearly
                    eliminate the effect of the eye movements parallel to each
                    type of pattern. Consequently, the neurons stimulated by the
                    disk convey the signal that the disk jitters due to the
                    horizontal component of the eye movements, while the neurons
                    stimulated by the background convey the signal that
                    movements are due to the independent vertical component.
                    Since the two regions jitter independently, the brain
                    interprets the regions as corresponding to separate
                    independent objects [2]

                    It’s worth checking out some of Ouchi’s other optical art as
                    well, I love his

                I've researched these illusions in my spare time but am clearly
                not any kind of expert and my explainations are pretty smooth
                brained, if you find something mis-cited, earlier examples, or
                general mistakes please new let me know via
